# This playbook demonstrates the basic interaction between Ansible's OpenStack
# cloud module and the Catalyst Cloud. Ansible will pick up the OpenStack
# environment variables from the operating system if an OpenStack RC file is
# sourced before running the playbook. Alternatively, you can specify the
# OpenStack authentication variables and refer to them when using the os_auth
# module.
