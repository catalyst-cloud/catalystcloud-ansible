#!/usr/bin/env ansible-playbook
#
# This playbook will gracefully remove an existing member from a load balancer
# pool.
# It first sets the weight of the member to 0, this will prevent the member
# accepting further connections.
# It then waits for the number of minutes set by the 'pause_duration' variable.
# Once this time has elapsed it will remove the member from the pool and then
# display the remaining pool members
#
# Usage:
# source openrc
# ansible-playbook drop_member_from_lb_pool.yaml
#
# or if wanting to override variables in the playbook
# ansible-playbook drop_member_from_lb_pool.yaml -e "lb_pool_name=http_pool lb_member_name=member_1 pause_duration=2"
